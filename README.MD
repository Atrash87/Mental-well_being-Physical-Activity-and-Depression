A comprehensive statistical analysis examining the protective effects of physical activity against depression using logistic regression and data visualization.

# Relationship between Physical Activity and Depression among Adults in Wuhan, China

This project explores the relationship between physical activity and depression among community-dwelling adults in Wuhan, China. The analysis was performed using a dataset collected from [source or bootcamp name], focusing on demographic, lifestyle, and health variables.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (pandas, numpy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Statistical analysis: correlation, regression, hypothesis testing
- Insights into the association between physical activity levels (IPAQ/MET) and depression scores (PHQ-9)
- Well-structured, reproducible Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding

## Folder Structure
- `data/` - raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` -  cleaning, EDA, analysis, and visualization notebooks
- `Multivariate logistic regression/` - Multivariate logistic regression functions
- `Final analysis with figures` - Final report and insights.
- `README.md` - project overview and instructions

### Original Study Background
This research addresses the limited evidence on physical activity and depression risk in Chinese populations. The original study employed stratified random sampling to recruit participants from five urban districts in Wuhan, China.

**Study Design**: Cross-sectional study  
**Participants**: 5,583 permanent residents aged ‚â•18 years  
**Measures**: 
- Physical Activity: International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF)
- Depression: 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
- Covariates: Demographics, BMI, chronic disease status, lifestyle factors
