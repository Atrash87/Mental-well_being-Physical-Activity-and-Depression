# Physical Activity and Depression Risk Analysis

A statistical analysis examining the protective effects of physical activity against depression, controlling for chronic disease, age, and BMI.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

### Strong Protective Effects:
- **High Physical Activity**: 52% lower depression risk (OR = 0.48, p < 0.001)
- **Moderate Physical Activity**: 38% lower risk (OR = 0.62, p < 0.001)
- **Older Age**: 3% lower risk per year (OR = 0.97, p < 0.001)

### Significant Risk Factors:
- **Chronic Disease**: 2.37Ã— higher risk (OR = 2.37, p < 0.001)
- **Underweight BMI**: 42% higher risk vs normal weight (OR = 1.42, p = 0.029)
